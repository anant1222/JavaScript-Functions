# JavaScript-Functions

In This Repo. see some important function used in java script. which is also most asked in interview...

1 #INVOKE FUNCTION.. There is no need to call the function. it call by it's self.. 
2 #CLOSURE FUNCTION.. This is basically follow parent and child role.. in this there is a function inside a other function like nested function we used,
child function is able to access the parent variable but parent can't access child variable..
